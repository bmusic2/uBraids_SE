# µBraids SE (uBraids, microBraids) Eurorack [Rev E]

## 8HP Eurorack module | Voltage-controlled digital oscillator

[µBraids SE](http://ubraids-se.com) is a voltage-controlled digital oscillator/sound source in 8HP with a wide range of creative and useful sound generation algorithms (aka models).

This re-engineered Eurorack module updates and simplifies the classic [Mutable Instruments Braids](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/braids/) design with a custom brilliant orange LED display module protected by a clear acrylic lens, a low-profile rotary encoder, and an added attenuverter.

Fully compatible with upstream Braids firmware. Includes power cable, mounting hardware, and a one-year warranty. Designed and built with care by [Tall Dog Electronics](http://tall-dog.com) in Western Massachusetts. Licensed [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) open source hardware.
