# About

*µBraids SE* (aka *uBraids SE* or *microBraids SE*) is a voltage-controlled digital oscillator/sound source in 8HP with a wide range of creative and useful sound generation algorithms (aka models).

This redesigned *µBraids SE* (Special Edition) is a new revision of *µBraids* that updates and simplifies the component layout and has a new panel design. It utilizes a custom miniature segmented LED module, eliminating the need for a 2nd microprocessor and its supporting circuitry. *µBraids SE* remains fully compatible with future upstream *Braids* firmware upgrades and any other alternate firmwares that are compliant with the standard *Braids* design.

# Included Parts

*µBraids SE* includes a standard 16-pin to 10-pin Eurorack power cable and two sets of mounting screws for racks/enclosures with either M2.5 or M3 threads.

# History

The original [*Braids*](http://mutable-instruments.net/modules/braids) was designed by [Olivier Gillet of *Mutable Instruments*](http://mutable-instruments.net/about) under a [CC BY-SA 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0) license. *Braids* is a macro-oscillator with multiple intricate digital synthesis algorithms. Each algorithm is controlled by two continuously variable parameters, both of which are voltage controllable. It is available as a 16HP Eurorack module.

The original [*microBraids* (aka *µBraids*)](http://store.magpiemodular.com/products/microbraids-pcb) is a full-functionality adaptation of *Braids* designed by [*Magpie Modular*](http://magpiemodular.com) and is available only as a bare PCB (printed circuit board). It is 8HP (exactly half the original width) and features an OLED display driven by a 2nd processor. Nothing else has been altered component-wise so any future firmware upgrades or alternate firmware such as [*Bees-in-the-Trees*](http://timchurches.github.io/Mutated-Mutables) will work fine.
